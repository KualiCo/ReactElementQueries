Element Queries
---------------

Element queries allow component to respond based on their parent container. They are similar to media queries. However, instead of doing queries against the device (or viewport), we perform queries
against the parent container. This allows the component do respond different based on whether it is in a side bar, versus the main container of a page. This allows for components that are not only responsive for different devices, but also responsive to their context.
